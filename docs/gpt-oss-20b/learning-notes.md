# GPT-OSS 20B Learning Notes

This document serves as a collaborative space for capturing insights, discoveries, and learning moments during the GPT-OSS 20B implementation process.

## üìÖ Learning Timeline

### Week 1: Initial Research

**Date**: 2025-09-9  
**Contributor**: Sam

#### Key Discoveries

- **Hugging Face CLI Authentication**: Successfully authenticated with Hugging Face using personal access token. The `hf auth login` command requires a token generated from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
- **Model Download Process**: GPT-OSS 20B model is distributed as multiple safetensors files (model-00000-of-00002.safetensors, model-00001-of-00002.safetensors, model-00002-of-00002.safetensors) totaling ~13.8GB
- **Model Structure**: The model includes configuration files (config.json, generation_config.json), tokenizer files (tokenizer.json, tokenizer_config.json), and chat template (chat_template.jinja)
- **Download Performance**: Initial download speeds were slow (~157kB/s for metal/model.bin), but other files downloaded much faster (up to 66.2MB/s for chat_template.jinja)

#### Questions Raised

- How will the large model size (13.8GB) impact deployment and inference performance?
- What are the optimal hardware requirements for running GPT-OSS 20B locally?
- How does the chat template (chat_template.jinja) work and how should it be integrated?

#### Next Steps

- [ ] Test model loading and basic inference capabilities
- [ ] Document hardware requirements and performance benchmarks
- [ ] Explore the chat template integration
- [ ] Set up proper model configuration for the Vitalis application
