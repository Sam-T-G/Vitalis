# Coding Standards and Project Guidelines

## Emoji Usage Policy

### Rule: No Emoji Usage in Project Files

**MANDATORY**: This project strictly prohibits the use of emojis in all code, documentation, project files, and Cursor workflows.

#### Rationale

- **Professional Standards**: Maintains professional appearance in all project materials
- **Accessibility**: Ensures compatibility across all systems and screen readers
- **Consistency**: Provides uniform formatting across all project documentation
- **Version Control**: Prevents encoding issues in Git repositories
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensures compatibility across different operating systems and editors

#### Scope of Application

This rule applies to:

- All source code files (.py, .js, .ts, .java, .cpp, etc.)
- All documentation files (.md, .txt, .rst, .docx, etc.)
- All configuration files (.json, .yaml, .toml, .ini, etc.)
- All project files (README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, etc.)
- All commit messages and pull request descriptions
- All comments and inline documentation
- All Cursor workflows and AI assistant interactions
- All terminal output and command responses
- All user interface text and messages

#### Enforcement

- **Code Reviews**: All pull requests will be reviewed for emoji usage
- **Linting**: Automated tools will flag emoji usage in code
- **Documentation**: All documentation must follow this standard
- **Templates**: All project templates will exclude emojis
- **AI Assistants**: All Cursor workflows and AI interactions must be emoji-free
- **Terminal Commands**: All command output and responses must be professional

#### Exceptions

**NO EXCEPTIONS** are permitted for this rule. All project materials must comply.

#### Examples

**PROHIBITED:**

```markdown
# Project Overview

This is an amazing project!

- Feature 1 - Completed
- Feature 2 - In Progress
```

**REQUIRED:**

```markdown
# Project Overview

This is an amazing project!

- Feature 2 - In Progress
```

**PROHIBITED:**

```python
